01-Caracteristics of Boltzmann Machine. 
-Undirected Model. 
-Hidden connected nodes. 
-Visible connected nodes. 
-No output layer. 
-Everything is connected to everything. 
-Representation of all system.
-Visible nodes are connected.
-Generate certain states at every nodes. 

02-Energy-Based Models
-Probability of certain state of the system. 
-Probability is inversely proportional to the energy. 
-Hight energy ~ Low Probability. 
-Weights of synopsis are adjusted to obtain the lowest energy state 
possible for the system.   

03-Restricted Boltzman Machines(RBM) 
-Restriction : visible nodes are not connecting. 
-Used to build recommander systems(movies).

04-Contrastive Divergence
-How the RBM is adjusting is weights? 
-Adjust the weights finding the minimal Energy State.
